# Quarterback Ratings Analysis

This project involved developing an automated QB rating analysis pipeline for QBs of a DIII college. The project aimed to streamline data processing and provide actionable performance insights through visualizations to football coaches.

## Project Structure

- `data_processing.py`: Handles data loading and preprocessing.
- `feature_extraction.py`: Extracts significant features from the model.
- `rating_calculation.py`: Calculates the passer rating for quarterbacks.
- `modeling.py`: Creates, fits, and compares models.
- `main.py`: Orchestrates the workflow by calling functions from the other modules.

## Important Note on Data and Findings
This project was originally conducted as part of a college analysis on QB ratings. Due to privacy reasons, the original dataset used in the project is not included here. Instead, this repository features sample data sourced from Kaggle, which closely follows the format and conventions of the original dataset.

As a result:
The findings and visualizations in this repository are derived from the sample data and may differ from the conclusions in the original analysis.
The code and report templates are consistent with the original work, providing a framework that can be adapted to other similar datasets.
